<h1 id="essential-economics">Essential Economics</h1>

<p>This chapter discusses terminology, stock market dynamics, and important indicators in
economics. This will allow us to more accurately judge the value of an economic decision
and make predictions on the market.</p>

<h2 id="funds">Funds</h2>

<p>We’ll discuss three different types of funds: Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), mutual funds,
and hedge funds. Different types of funds are governed under different rules. ETFs are
similar to stocks in that they are bought and sold at will like stocks- very liquid. However,
ETFs typically represent baskets of stocks, and it is known to the trader what the fund represents.
Mutual funds can only be bought and sold at the end of the day, and the holdings
within a mutual fund are only disclosed every quarter. The least transparent holdings are
that of a hedge fund. Before investors can buy shares in the fund, they must sign a long
term agreement and holdings are rarely disclosed.</p>

<h3 id="about-funds">About Funds</h3>

<p>For stocks and ETFs, having a large ”cap” means that the total value of stocks (number
of stocks × price of a stock) in a company is worth many billions of dollars. Moreover,
the price of a stock doesn’t reflect the value of a company, but the price at which they are
selling shares. ETFs, like stocks, can easily be traded through individuals alone, whereas
shares in mutual funds require a broker and hedge fund shares require more of a one on
one relationship. Managers of ETFs and mutual funds are compensated based on expense
ratios, which denote a percentage of Assets Under Management (AUM). For an ETF, expense
ratios range from 0.01% to 1%, and in mutual funds from 0.5% to 3%. Hedge funds
follow a ”two and twenty” policy, where managers get 2% of the AUM and 20% of the profits.</p>

<p>The type of a fund can be more easily recognized by how it’s named. For example, an
ETF has a ticker, or stock symbol, with three or four letters, like AAPL. A mutual fund
has five letters, like VTINX, and a hedge fund doesn’t have a ticker because shares are
much less liquid. How much money is managed by a fund is known as the AUM, and shares
represent percentages of the AUM.</p>

<p>It’s fairly clear to see that hedge funds are very different from ETFs and mutual funds.
Hedge funds typically have no more than 100 investors, whereas ETFs and mutual funds
have thousands. Those that invest in hedge funds are typically very wealthy individuals,
institutions, and funds of funds. Funds of funds typically take large sums of money from
potentially many places and invest in several hedge funds. This is a bridge for smaller
investors to participate in hedge fund. The goal of a hedge fund typically falls along the
lines of two ideals. The hedge fund may be out to beat a bench mark which is to say that
the hedge fund aims to outperform an index of stocks. A hedge fund could also aim for
absolute return, which translates to net positive profit no matter what, but usually takes
more time and has fewer returns as a trade off for stability. We’ll be focusing on hedge
funds because they are the most computationally demanding.</p>

<h3 id="fund-metrics-and-operations">Fund Metrics and Operations</h3>

<p>Measuring the performance of a fund is vital for making financial decisions in the market,
so here we’ll discuss a few. Overall success can be measured by cumulative return, which
is the percentage of an original value made in a given time: $\dfrac{\textrm{end - start}}{start}$.
However, this means little if the portfolio is rapidly and wildly fluctuating. Hence it’s also useful to measure the
volatility of a portfolio. This is simply measured by the standard deviation of daily returns;
it’s best to have low volatility. Another important measure is the return on risks. This is
done by calculating the Sharpe Ratio (SR), also called risk-adjusted reward.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  $SR = \sqrt{252} \dfrac{mean(\textrm{daily returns} - \textrm{risk free rate})} {volatility}$
</div>

<p>The factor of $\sqrt{252}$ comes from the number of trading days in a year. These factors can
give us an idea of how well a portfolio is performing.</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, hedge funds are very computationally intensive environments.
Let’s delve into the details of how a typical hedge fund works. Central to the operation of
a hedge fund is its trading algorithms. Normally, a target portfolio is decided upon, then
historical stock data and the target portfolio are fed to the trading algorithms to produce
orders. The orders are sent to the market to alter the live portfolio, which is again fed back
into trading algorithms.</p>

<p><img src="/7646/images/fig3.1.png" alt="Trading_algorithm" /></p>

<p>Trading algorithms work to place certain orders at the proper time. For example, an
order for everything in the target portfolio shouldn’t be placed all at once because the price
of the stock will go up and more money is spent than if strategic ordering were implemented.
Additionally, there is another set of computational structures for determining the target
portfolio.</p>

<p><img src="/7646/images/fig3.2.png" alt="Portfolio_optimization" /></p>

<p>Historical data, current portfolio, and prediction algorithms are fed into an optimization
program to produce a target portfolio. The majority of machine learning comes into play
when determining the market forecast.</p>

<h2 id="market-mechanics">Market Mechanics</h2>

<h3 id="ordering">Ordering</h3>

<p>The live portfolio is altered by giving orders to a broker in the stock market, so it serves to
know what exactly is in an order. The broker needs to know whether to buy or sell and of
which stock(s) by their market symbols. The order must also contain the number of shares
and the type of order. Stock exchanges only consider limit orders and market orders, but
note that orders can be increasingly complex based on instructions given to a broker. A
market order is an order at the current market price, and ordering at a limit price tells the
broker to only buy or sell at a certain price; for example, some may not want to buy beyond
some value or sell below some price. Of course, a limit order must also include the desired
price.</p>

<p><img src="/7646/images/table3.1.png" alt="Example_orders_list" /></p>

<p>After the broker sends the order to the stock exchange, it is made public in the style
of an ”order book”. Others can see the stocks and collective bids that have been made on
them, but not who has placed the orders. The order book contains a list for each stock of
the orders within it including whether the order asks for others to buy or bids on the stock.
Both types include a price at which orders are allowed to be bought/sold at and the size of
the order. Orders of the same type and price are lumped together. Market orders always
sell at the highest bid and buy at the lowest asking price.</p>

<p><img src="/7646/images/table3.2.png" alt="Example_orders_book" /></p>

<p>The example order book suggests that the price of the stock will decrease because there
is much more selling pressure- more are selling than buying.</p>

<h3 id="dynamics-of-exchange">Dynamics of Exchange</h3>

<p>There are many stock exchanges, and each has its own order book. When an order is placed,
say by an individual, the order is sent to the broker and the broker chooses between the
stock exchanges to execute that order. The broker takes information from all the stock
exchanges and makes a transaction based on which one has the stock with the best price.
Fees are associated with making transactions in stock exchanges and with using a broker. A
broker typically has many clients; the broker can observe clients who want to buy and sell
at the same price and circumvent stock exchanges entirely. The law ensures that this trade
can only happen if both the buyer and seller get prices that are at least as good as at an
exchange. Even if this transaction cuts out the stock exchange, it must still be registered
with one, and it’s usually with the exchange the stock is housed.</p>

<p>Orders can be handled internally or moved through what’s called a ”dark pool”. A dark
pool is a place where investors can trade without the transparency of an order book outside
of a stock exchange. The results of the trade, like internal trades, still need to be registered
with public exchanges after they’ve occured. A dark pool can act as an intermediary between
all types of investors that may want to escape the transparency of stock exchanges.
Brokers like this because they don’t have to pay fees associated with trading at a stock
exchange. They also argue that it’s fair because clients are getting prices that are as good
as at the market. However, hedge funds and dark pools can heavily exploit this system as
it stands if they have well-placed, fast computers.</p>

<h3 id="exploiting-the-market">Exploiting the Market</h3>

<p>These days the market is entirely digital and computers automate transactions all across
the country. As a result, orders can be processed in fractions of a second, and timing is
everything. A hedge fund may pay stock exchanges enough money to house computers very
close to the exchanges, which gives them a distinct advantage. For example, let’s say that
someone places an order for a stock, and it’s sent to multiple markets. A hedge fund close
to those markets can see that order reach one of them first and buy up that stock from the
other exchanges through the high speed infrastructure they have in place. Then when that
order reaches other exchanges, the hedge fund has already bought those shares and sells it
back at a higher price. This is one of many strategies in High Frequency Trading (HFT)
that takes place on the order of milliseconds.</p>

<p>This can also happen on an international scale. A hedge fund may have computers collocated
with international markets rapidly observing and comparing order books between
them. If a difference occurs in a stock between the two markets, all that needs to be done
is to sell in the market with a higher price and buy in the market with a lower one. This
happens very quickly, so the price of the stock is not very different at different markets.
HFT strategies usually trade high volumes to turn a large profit in small price differences.</p>

<p>Those that operate on HFT strategies can not only manipulate a transparent market,
but also a dark one. First, let’s explain why someone would want to use a dark pool. For
example, an investor who wants to sell a high volume of shares in a transparent market
would want to do so in small chunks so as not to upset the price all at once and get less for
the shares. However, others will see this and lower their bids knowing that a high volume is
to be sold and the investor still gets less for their shares. In a dark pool, others can’t see
those that want to buy or sell, so the investor may get a better price. There are many ways
to exploit a dark pool, but it always stems from information leakage. Knowing the order
book of a dark pool means a world of advantage. Dark pool operators or constituents may
secretly participate in their own pool or leak information about it to others for a price. The
private nature of a dark pool allows those who operate it to make their own rules about
who can participate and how trading works. Since information is at the discretion of the
operator, it’s fairly easy for those with direct access to exploit a dark pool. Those that
don’t have direct access can ”game” the pool by probing it with many small volume orders.
This yields some idea of the size and prices of bids, which gamers can exploit by selling
when they find the bids are highest and buying when asking is lowest.</p>

<h3 id="other-orders-and-shorting">Other Orders and Shorting</h3>

<p>Although exchanges only take market and limit orders, other orders can be made through
a broker. Often a broker implements them for clients without their knowledge to benefit
both themselves and the client. The most simple order above a limit order is a stop-loss
order. The broker holds stock until the price drops below a certain price, then sells at
market price. Similarly, a stop-gain order waits until the price climbs to a point at which
the client wants to sell. Slightly more complex is the trailing stop. Here the broker sets a
stop-loss criteria trailing a stock that’s increasing in price. As the price increases, so does
the stop-loss criteria; when that stock starts to decrease, the stop-loss criteria is met and
stocks are sold.</p>

<p>What if someone wanted to bet that a stock will decrease and still profit? Instead of just
selling high and buying low, those stocks can be borrowed and sold, so the value of those
stocks is gained at a high point but the stocks are still owed. Then when the price of the
stock decreases, the stock can be bought at a lower value, and the shares returned to whom
they were borrowed while a profit on the difference was made. This is called shorting. As
long as the price of the stock goes down, this is a good strategy; however, if the price goes
up, then the difference results in a net loss.</p>

<h2 id="worth-company-valuation">Worth: Company Valuation</h2>

<p>The price of a company’s stock is intended to reflect the value of the company. Ergo, if
the price of a company’s stock deviates significantly from its predicted value based on the
company’s predicted worth, then there’s a profitable opportunity for when it returns to
reflect the company’s worth. The value of the company can be estimated several different
ways. One way is to estimate its intrinsic value, which is based on the future dividends the
company will give; these are annual payments to stockholders. This doesn’t really describe
what the company has though. The book value of a company is founded in the company’s
assets like its facilities and resources. A company’s market cap is yet another way to estimate
a company’s worth, and it’s easiest to calculate. This is effectively what the stock
market thinks what the company is worth and it’s the value of a stock multiplied by the
total number of stocks.</p>

<p>Intrinsic value may not make sense if we try to imagine the value of a company that
will pay dividends consistently as long as it stands. However, the company can never be
100% reliable, so the value of its dividends amount to the value of a promise. The promise
of some money in a year is worth less than the same amount given right now because of
this principle. Thus, the value of a those promised dividends decreases as the time they’re
promised is longer, so the total value will converge to a calculable value. Similarly, we can
calculate the present value (PV) of a dollar that is promised after a certain time. It makes
sense that the PV of a dollar promised right now is a dollar, but what about in a year?
The PV is some fraction of its future value (FV) based interest rate (IR) and the length of
time, <code>$t$</code>.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  $PV = \dfrac{FV}{(1&#43;IR)^t}$
</div>

<p>In this way we have a conversion between the present value and future value of some amount
of money. The interest rate is also called the discount rate and it reflects the risk involved
with investment. A more stable company will have a lower discount rate because they’re
more reliable. The intrinsic value, IV, of a company can be calculated knowing its discount
rate and dividend payments by</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  $IV = \dfrac{FV}{IR}$
</div>

<p>Thus, if a hypothetical company pays dividends of \$5 a year and has a discount rate of
1%, then the value of this company is <code>$ \dfrac{$5}{0.01} = \$500 $</code>. Book value of a company is simple
to calculate because it is just what the company has versus what the company owes. If
a company only has a factory worth \$1 million, a patent worth \$500,000, and a loan of
\$200,000, then the company is worth \$1 million − 200,000 = \$0.8 million. The patent is
considered an intangible asset and isn’t counted in calculating the book value.</p>

<p>News about companies can drastically change some of these measures. Investors reflect
their opinions on the worth of a company through stocks- if they feel the company is worth
less, they will sell and vice versa. Let’s say bad news about a company comes up; investors
will see that as increased risk in investing in the company. The company will have to increase
their IR to appease investors and the intrinsic value of the company will reduce. This
would also reduce the stock price of the company, which decreases the market capitalization
of the company. News can affect singular companies, sectors of business, and the market as
a whole depending on the scope of the news.</p>

<p>Market strategies are based on deviations in the estimated values of a company. For
example, if the intrinsic value of a company drops and the stock price is relatively high given
its history, then it would probably be a good idea to short that stock because the price will
almost certainly go down. The book value of a company provides somewhat of a minimum
for the market cap; that is because if the market cap goes below the book value, then a
predatory buyer typically buys the whole company, breaks it apart, and sells its parts for
the book value to turn a profit.</p>

<h2 id="the-capital-assets-pricing-model">The Capital Assets Pricing Model</h2>

<p>The Capital Assets Pricing Model (CAPM) is a model that is used to predict the return of
stocks. To understand this model, a portfolio must be understood in more depth. The term
portfolio has been used throughout this text, but has yet to be clearly defined; a portfolio
is a set of weighted assets, namely stocks. A portfolio is a set of stocks that are weighted
by their value, and all the weights add to 1. Some stocks might be shorted, so technically
their portfolio value is negative and really the sum of the absolute value of their weights is
mathematically written, where <code>$ w_i$</code> is the weight of a stock in a portfolio</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  $\sum_{i} |w_i| = 1$
</div>

<p>and the return of the portfolio for a given day is</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  $\sum_{i} w_i r_i$
</div>

<p>where <code>$r_i$</code> is the return for a stock in a day. As an example, lets say a portfolio is composed
of two stocks, A and B, and their respective weights are 0.75 and -0.25 because stock B is
shorted. Then if on a given day, stock A increases by 1% and stock B decreases by 2%, the
result is a portfolio return of (0.75)(0.01) + (−0.25)(−0.02) = 1.25%.</p>

<p>A similar portfolio can be made for entire markets. Although, it’s typically limited to
an index which includes the largest companies in a market, like the S&amp;P 500 for the US
market. These companies are weighted by their market caps, so a company’s weight in the
market is approximately that company’s cap, c, divided by the sum of all caps.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  $w_i = \dfrac{c_i}{\sum_{j} c_i}$
</div>

<p>The CAPM predicts the return on stocks within a certain market with the simple equation</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  $r_i[t] = \beta_i r_m[t] &#43; \alpha_i[t]$
</div>

<p>This says that the return of a stock is largely based on the return of the market as a whole,
$r_m$. The degree to which a stock is affected is based on that stocks particular $\beta$ value.
Fluctuations that deviate from this are represented in the (theoretically) random variable,
$\alpha$, which (theoretically) has an expected value of zero. The $\beta$ and $\alpha$ values of a stock are
calculated based on the historical data of daily returns. The daily returns of a stock are
plotted against that of the market and the slope of the fitted line constitutes the $\beta$ value.
The y-intercept and random deviations describe the $\alpha$ value.</p>

<h3 id="capm-and-related-theories">CAPM and Related Theories</h3>

<p>The nature of CAPM suggests a specific strategy when approaching the market. CAPM
says that the relationship of stocks to the market is linear with an average fluctuation of
zero from this relationship. This suggests that the best tactic is to simply choose a set of
stocks that will perform well with a certain market environment and sit on them. Active
management is a way of thinking that believes the $\alpha$ value is not entirely random and can
be predicted. This mindset promotes carefully choosing and trading stocks on a regular
basis depending on predicted $\alpha$ values. This is the dichotomy between active and passive
portfolio management. If we assume that $\alpha$ is entirely random, then the only way we can
beat the market is by predicting the return on the market. However, this is not entirely
true, and CAPM will be used to eliminate market risk entirely.</p>

<p>CAPM gives $\beta$ values to each stock, but there are other theories that say it’s more
complicated. One of these is the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT), which says that there is
not a contribution based on the whole market, but based on its sectors. Moreover, a stock
is affected by what happens in the ten different sectors of the economy, and the CAPM
equation becomes</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  $r_i = \sum_{j} \beta_{ij}r_j[t] &#43; \alpha_i[t]$
</div>

<p>where $j$ denotes the different sectors. This provides a more in-depth prediction of stock
return.</p>

<h3 id="using-the-capm">Using the CAPM</h3>

<p>Now we want to use the CAPM to create a lucrative portfolio. If we say that the return on
the market can never be predicted, then any component associated with market return is
risk. Applying the CAPM equation to get an overall portfolio return yields</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  $r_p = \sum_{i} w-I[\beta_ir_m(t)&#43;\alpha_i(t)] $
</div>

<p>The only way to remove the market return component is to choose weights such that $\sum_{i}w_i\beta_i = 0$.
At this point it may seem that there will not be an expected return for
the portfolio because CAPM predicts $\alpha$ to be random. It is here that the assumptions of
CAPM are wrong. Using some information, we can predict whether a stock will perform
better or worse than the market, which will yield a profit regardless of which way the market
goes. This information can come from expertise, some analysis, or, in our case, machine
learning.</p>

<h2 id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2>

<p>There are effectively two kinds of analysis: fundamental and technical. Fundamental analysis
looks at the properties of a company to determine market decisions. Technical analysis
looks at patterns in stock prices to make market decision; since technical analysis is clearly
more useful aside from predatory buying, that’s what will be discussed.</p>

<p>Technical analysis only focuses on stock price and volume. Using these to calculate
statistics gives indications on what economic decisions to make. Technical analysis is most
useful on shorter time scales and when combinations of indicators point to the same decision.
HFT trade at the millisecond timescale and fundamental analysis firms operate at the
timescale of years; humans and computers tend to work together at a timescale in between.</p>

<h3 id="some-good-indicators">Some Good Indicators</h3>

<p>It’s useful to develop strategies based on time-series indicators, so here are a few. <strong>Momentum</strong>
is a scale dependent indicator that suggests an upward or downward trend depending on
slope. Moreover, an n-day momentum, $m$, for a stock with price function, $p[t]$, is calculated
as</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  $m = \dfrac{p[t]-p[t-n]}{p[t-n]} = \dfrac{p[t]}{p[t-n]} - 1$
</div>

<p>This is simply the difference in price as a ratio to the price n days ago. Typically 5, 10,
or 20 day momentum is used with values ranging from -0.5 to 0.5. Another indicator is a
<strong>simple moving average (SMA)</strong>; SMA is also scale dependent looking over an n-day window.
The price of a stock over n days is averaged and plotted over time where points are placed
at the leading end of the window. However, to get a useful value, this needs to be compared
to the real time price. Like momentum, it is done as a ratio</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  $SMA[n] = \dfrac{p[t]-E(p[t-n:t])}{E(p[t-n:t])} = \dfrac{p[t]}{E(p[t-n:t])} - 1$
</div>

<p>Momentum and SMA together often prove to be strong indicators. For example, if there
is strong positive momentum and a crossing of the price from the price being lower than
the average to above- this is a good indicator the price will increase. Larger than normal
deviations from the moving average are expected to return back to the average and indicate
opportunities. Thus, if SMA is positive, it’s a selling opportunity, and a buying opportunity
if SMA is negative.</p>

<p>How those decision are made depends on the state of the stock, or its volatility. The
standard deviation of the stock’s fluctuations provides an excellent measure for when to
make decisions. It depends on how certain we want to be that the price is an outlier. The
farther the decision threshold is from the SMA, the more certain we are that the price is an
anomaly. From basic statistics, if the decision threshold is placed two standard deviations
away from the SMA, then we are 95% sure the price is an anomaly. These bands, typically
at two standard deviations away from SMA, are called Bollinger bands. The way this is
written mathematically is, again, a ratio, which is between the price difference and the $2\sigma$
length where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  $BB[t] = \dfrac{p[t] - SMA[t]}{2\sigma}$
</div>

<p>When making economic decisions, a Bollinger band value greater than 1 denotes a selling
opportunity, and less than -1 denotes a buying opportunity. However, it’s better to trade
when the price crosses the band for the second time because that signals the price moving
in a profitable direction.</p>

<p>When using these values in a machine learner, it’s important that indicators are normalized.
To normalize values, follow</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  $normal = \dfrac{value-mean}{\sigma}$
</div>

<p>This provides a z-score by which to compare everything.</p>

<h3 id="adjusted-prices">Adjusted Prices</h3>

<p>Analysis of historical data is crucial for determining patterns and making economic decisions,
but some things drastically change the price of stocks without having any effect on
the real value of the stock. Dividends and stock splits are two things that do just that.
The adjusted price accounts for these events and corrects the computational problems that
would occur if only the price were taken into account.</p>

<p>Stock splits occur when the price of a stock is too high and the company decides to cut
the price, but increase the volume so that the overall market cap is the same. This is a
problem when dealing with data because it’s seen as a large drop in price. The adjusted
price is calculated going backwards in time; moreover, the given and adjusted price are the
same for a certain starting present day and adjusted going backward in time. If the price
is ever split, say by 3, then at the time of the split, the price is divided by 3 so that there
is no discontinuity.</p>

<p>At the time a company announces the date for payment of dividends, the price of the
stock will increase by the amount of a dividend until they’re paid at which point the price
rapidly decreases by that amount. This is adjusted looking back in time, and on the day
a dividend is paid, the prices preceding are decreased by the proportion of the dividend
payment.</p>

<p>As a note for machine learning, the data that is chosen for the learner is very important.
If the stocks from today are chosen and analyzed starting from 7 years ago, then those stocks
will of course do well because they’ve survived. That’s using a biased strategy, so what needs
to be done is to take index stocks from 7 years ago and run with those. For adjusted price,
it’s also important to note that the adjusted price will be different depending on where the
starting point is chosen, and that should also be taken into account.</p>

<h2 id="efficient-markets-hypothesis">Efficient Markets Hypothesis</h2>

<p>Until now, we’ve been assuming, for technical analysis, that there is information in historical
data that we can exploit to determine what the market is going to do. The same goes
for fundamental analysis in terms of fundamental data. However, the Efficient Markets
Hypothesis says that we’re wrong on both accounts!</p>

<p>Here are some assumptions of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Large number of investors:</strong> The most important assumption of EMH is that there
are a large number of investors for-profit. They have incentive to find where the price
of a stock is out of line with its true value. Because there are so many investors, any
time new information comes out, the price is going to change accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>New information arrives randomly</strong></li>
<li><strong>Prices adjust quickly</strong></li>
<li><strong>Prices reflect all available information</strong></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="the-three-forms-of-the-emh">The three forms of the EMH</h3>

<p>There are 3 forms of the EMH, ranging from weak to strong.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Weak:</strong> Future prices cannot be predicted by analyzing historical prices. This leaves room
for fundamental analysis, however.</li>
<li><strong>Semi-strong:</strong> Prices adjust rapidly to new public information</li>
<li><strong>Strong Prices:</strong> Prices reflect all information, public and private</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="is-the-emh-correct">Is the EMH correct?</h3>

<p>If the EMH is correct, a lot of what we’re trying to do is impossible, so we should cut our
losses and go home. Luckily, there is evidence for why certain versions of the hypothesis are
incorrect. The existence of hedge funds indicates that you can profit by investing in stocks
other than the market portfolio.</p>

<p>The strong version is the weakest of the three, considering there are many examples of
insiders using esoteric information for their own benefit. And in many cases, these people
have gone to jail!</p>

<p>There is also data that shows that the semi-strong version isn’t too likely to be correct. You
can see trends in 20-year annualized returns versus 10-year P/E ratio data, which means
that you most likely can use fundamentals to predict future performance.</p>

<h2 id="the-fundamental-law-of-active-portfolio-management">The Fundamental Law of Active Portfolio Management</h2>

<p>Richard Grinold was trying to find a way of relating performance, skill, and breadth. For
example, you might have lots of skill to pick stocks well, but you might not have the breadth
to use that skill. So he developed the following relationship:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  $performance = skill\sqrt{breadth}$
</div>

<p>So we need some way of measuring skill and breadth. Performance is summarized by
something called the <strong>information ratio</strong>:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  $IR = IC\sqrt{BR}$
</div>

<p>where IC is the <strong>information coefficient</strong>, and BR is the number of trading opportunities we
have.</p>

<h3 id="the-coin-flipping-casino">The Coin-flipping Casino</h3>

<p>As a thought experiment, instead of buying and selling stocks, we’re going to flip coins, and
bet on the outcome. This is analogous to buying a stock and holding it– either you earn or
lose money.</p>

<p>The coin is biased (like $\alpha$) to P(heads) = .51. The uncertainty of the outcome is like $\beta$.</p>

<p><strong>Betting:</strong> Betting works by betting on N coins. If we win, we now have 2N coins. If we
lose, we now have 0 coins, so this is an even-money bet (you either gain N coins or lose N
coins.)</p>

<p><strong>The Casino:</strong> The casino has 1000 tables, each with a biased coin, and you have 1000
tokens, so you can bet them in any way you like: 10 tokens each on 100 tables, 1 token on
each table, or 1000 tokens on 1 table. Once bets have been placed, the coins are all flipped
in parallel, and for each game you either lose your chips or win.
So now the question is what scenario is going to net you the best outcome? Let’s take the
following two bets for example:</p>

<ol>
<li>1000 tokens on one table and 0 on the other 999</li>
<li>1 token on each of 1000 tables</li>
</ol>

<p>Which is better? Or are they the same? In fact, the expected return of both bets are the
same, but bet 2 is much less risky, as with bet 1, if you lose, you lose all of your money, but
with bet 2, you might lose around half your money. In fact, the chance of losing all of your
money (if you bet tails) is:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  $(.49)^{1000} \approx 10^{-310}$
</div>

<p>To determine which is best, we need to consider risk and reward. In this case, the reward is
our expected return. If $P_w$ is the chance we would win, and $P_l$
is the chance that we would lose, and $W$ is the amount we would win, whereas $L$ is the amount we’d lose, expected
return for a single bet is calculated as follows:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  $E[R] = P_wW &#43; P_lL$
</div>

<p>For the biased coin where we place all of our bets on one table, this would be:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  $E[R] = .51(\$1000) &#43; .49(−\$1000) = \$20$
</div>

<p>If we placed 1 token on each table, the expected return would be:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  $E[R] = \sum_{i=1}^{1000} .51(\$1) &#43; \sum_{i=1}^{1000} .49(−\$1000) = \$20$
</div>

<p>So, in terms of reward, neither is better or worse. So how do we choose how to allocate the
tokens? It turns out that the risk makes it easy to choose.</p>

<p>First, what’s the chance that we lose it all? For the case where all of our tokens are on one
table, the chance is 49%. For the second table, it’s around $10^{-308}%, which is quite a bit
smaller&hellip;</p>

<p>Another way to look at the risk is by looking at the standard deviation of the bets. An
example of the outcomes for situation 2 is:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  $−1, 1, 1, 1, −1, −1, 1, −1, ..., 1$
</div>

<p>The standard deviation of which is just 1. Now, for the case where we put all of our tokens
on one table, the outcomes look like this:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  $1000, 0, 0, 0, 0, ..., 0$
</div>

<p>or</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  $−1000, 0, 0, 0, 0, ..., 0$
</div>

<p>The standard deviation (risk) in both cases is $\sqrt{1000} \approx 31.62$, which is much higher than
the standard deviation for putting bets on each table. Now, we can create a risk-adjusted reward (Sharpe Ratio) for the single-bet case:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  $R_s = \dfrac{\$20}{\$31.62} = 0.63$
</div>

<p>For the multi-bet scenario, it’s:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  $R_m = \dfrac{\$20}{\$1} = 20.0$
</div>

<p>Clearly, the second case wins based on this ratio. Something interesting about these results
is that:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  $20 = .63\sqrt{1000}$
</div>

<p>It turns out that this can be generalized to</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  $SR_{multi} = SR_{single}\sqrt{bets}$
</div>

<p>Which shows that as we increase the number of bets (diversify), the Sharpe Ratio increases.
This is the relationship described in the Fundamental Law of Active Portfolio Management;
to increase performance, you can either increase skill or diversify (bets), although diversification
only goes as the square root.</p>

<p>Now, back to equation 3.1. Let’s define what information ratio means. If we consider the
CAPM equation:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  $r_p[t] = \beta_p r_m[t] &#43; \alpha_p[t]$
</div>

<p>we can associate the first term, $\beta_p r_m[t]$ with the market, and the second term, $\alpha_p[t]$ with
skill. Information ratio is defined as:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  $IR = \dfrac{\overline{\alpha_p[t]}} {\sigma_{\alpha_p[t]}}$
</div>

<p>Information ratio can be thought of as a Sharpe Ratio of excess return (due to skill). Now,
the information coefficient, IC, is the correlation of forecasts to returns. IC can range
from 0 (no skill) to 1 (perfect skill). BR, or breadth, is the number of trading opportunities
per year. For example, if you are Warren Buffet, and hold only 120 stocks for a whole
year, BR is just 120. However, if you have 120 stocks and trade them daily, $BR = 120∗365$.</p>

<p>Let’s do an example: say that James Simons and Warren Buffet both have the same information
ratio, and that Simons’ algorithm is <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1000</sub> as smart as Buffet’s. Buffet only
trades 120 times per year. How many trades per year must Simons execute to have the
same information ratio (performance)?</p>

<p><div style="text-align: center;">
  $IR_S = IC_S\sqrt{BR_S}$
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  $IR_B = IC_B\sqrt{BR_B}$
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  $IR_S = 1/1000IC_B$
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  $\dfrac{IR_B}{IR_S} = \dfrac{IC_S\sqrt{BR_S}}{IC_B\sqrt{BR_B}} = 1$
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  $= \dfrac{\dfrac{1}{1000}\sqrt{BR_S}}{\sqrt{BR_B}}$
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  $\Rightarrow BR_S = (1000)^2 BR_B$
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  $= 120,000,000$
</div></p>

<p>So Simons must execute 120 million trades, whereas Buffet only needs to execute 120.
That’s quite a difference! Indeed, skill is an extremely important factor in performance.</p>

<h2 id="portfolio-optimization">Portfolio Optimization</h2>

<p>Now we wish to optimize a portfolio, and what this means is minimizing risk for a given
target return. Risk is largely defined as the volatility of a stock. A portfolio is composed of
some stocks that individually have their own return-risk ratios, but it is possible to weight
them such that the return-risk ratio of the portfolio is higher than that of any individual
stock.</p>

<p>This is done through combining correlated and anti-correlated stocks to highly reduce
volatility. In the case of a highly correlated group of stocks, their combination results in
a similar volatility, but if they’re combined with highly anti-correlated stocks, then with
accurate weighting, fluctuations cancel out and volatility is minimal while yielding similar
returns. A useful algorithm to find the best weighting is mean variance optimization
(MVO). <em>This algorithm is not explained, but we should find it</em>. MVO and similar
algorithms find the minimal risk for a given target return, and if this is plotted over
all target returns, we get a curve called the efficient frontier. On a return-risk plot, a line
tangent to the efficient frontier with an intercept at the origin also points to the portfolio
with the minimal Sharpe ratio.</p>
