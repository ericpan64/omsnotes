<h2 id="types-of-viruses-and-worm-overview">Types of Viruses and Worm Overview</h2>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig15.0.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In this lesson we will talk about viruses and internet worms. Let&rsquo;s first define what a virus is, and
then define what a worm is. A virus is effectively an infection of an existing program that results
in the modification of the original program&rsquo;s behavior. A worm is code that propagates and
replicates itself across the network. A worm is usually spread by exploiting flaws in existing
programs or open services whereas viruses typically require user action to spread, for example,
opening an attachment on an email or running an executable file that a friend gave you on an
USB key. Worms propagate automatically. We will focus most of our attention on internet
worms.</p>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig15.1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>But before we dive into the details of internet worms, let&rsquo;s first talk about the different types of
viruses. A parasitic virus typically infects an existing executable file. A memory- resident virus
infects running programs. A boot-sector virus spreads whenever the system is booted. A
polymorphic virus encrypts part of the virus program using a randomly generated key. So one of
the key differences between viruses and worms is that viruses typically spread with manual user
intervention. Worms typically spread automatically by scanning for vulnerabilities and infecting
vulnerable hosts when those vulnerabilities are discovered. A worm might use any of these
techniques to infect a particular host before spreading further.</p>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig15.2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In the rest of the lesson we will first talk about a brief history of internet worms, including the
first Internet worm, called the Morris worm, and other famous Internet worms from the early
days of Internet worms in the early 2000&rsquo;s, including Code Red and other well-known Internet
worms of the time. We&rsquo;ll then talk about how to model the spread of a worm in terms of scanning
and infection rates, using analogies from epidemiology. Finally, we&rsquo;ll talk about design
techniques for designing super fast-spreading worms, and we&rsquo;ll look at an example of a super
fast-spreading worm.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s have a quiz to review our knowledge of the difference between worms and viruses. So
what&rsquo;s the main difference between a worm and a virus? Is it that worms do not have destructive
payloads, whereas viruses do? Is it that viruses only infect Windows machines, whereas worms
can infect any kind of machine? Is it that viruses can spread more rapidly than worms? Or is that
worms can spread automatically without human intervention, whereas viruses require human
intervention to spread?</p>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig15.4.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The main difference between worms and viruses is that, worms can spread automatically by
scanning for vulnerable hosts and spreading, whereas viruses typically require user intervention
to spread such as clicking on an executable file in an email attachment or installing a particular
program from a USB stick.</p>

<h2 id="internet-worm-lifecycle">Internet Worm Lifecycle</h2>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig15.5.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>A worm&rsquo;s spread on the internet has the following life cycle. First, the infected machine might
scan other machines on the internet to discover vulnerable hosts and subsequently infect the
vulnerable machines that it discovers via remote exploit. Let&rsquo;s take a look at a couple of well
known early worms and how they spread, as well as how one might design a super fast spreading
worm.</p>

<h3 id="first-worm">First Worm</h3>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig15.6.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The first worm was designed by Robert Morris, Jr. in 1988. The worm itself had no malicious
payload, but it ended up bogging down the machines that it infected by spawning new processes
uncontrollably and exhausting resources. And at the time it was released, it affected ten percent
of all Internet hosts. It spread through three different propagation vectors. The worm tried to
crack passwords using a small dictionary and a publicly readable password file, and also targeted
hosts that were already listed in a trusted host file on the machine that was already infected. This
ability to perform remote execution was one way that the worm was allowed to spread. The
second way that it spread was in a buffer overflow vulnerability in the finger demon. This was a
standard buffer overflow exploit. And if you don&rsquo;t know about buffer overflows, I would urge
you to take a computer security course, but essentially, this is a very common attack that makes
remote exploits possible, effectively resulting in the ability to run arbitrary code at the root level
privilege. The third way that worm spread, was via the debug command in send mail, which is a
mail sending service. In early send mail versions, it was possible to execute a command on a
remote machine by sending an SMTP message. The worm used this capability to spread
automatically. A key theme that we&rsquo;ll see In the design of other worms, is this use of multiple
vectors. Now any particular worm may end up using a different set of vectors depending on the
remote vulnerabilities that it&rsquo;s trying to exploit. But the idea that any worm should be able to
exploit multiple weaknesses in a system gives it more ways to spread and often also speeds up
the propagation of the worm. This worm design also followed the following general approach,
which we see showing up over and over again in worm designs. First, the worm needs to scan
other hosts to find potentially vulnerable hosts. In the second step, it needs to spread by infecting
other vulnerable hosts. And in the third step it needs to remain undiscoverable and undiscovered
so that it can continue to operate and spread without being removed from systems.</p>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig15.7.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>So to review, what are the three steps in a worm&rsquo;s life cycle? Please check three of the following
options. Infecting a vulnerable host, patching the hosts vulnerability after infection, scanning for
other vulnerable hosts to infect, or remaining undetectable.</p>

<h3 id="worm-lifecycle-quiz-answer">Worm Lifecycle Quiz Answer</h3>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig15.8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>An Internet worm first scans for vulnerable hosts, then infects them, and finally, typically takes
steps to remain undetectable. A worm does not necessarily need to patch the host vulnerability,
although some Internet worms have been known to do so to prevent other worms from
subsequently infecting the machine and interfering with the original worm infection. For
example, if a worm was intending to spread to construct a botnet that launched a particular attack
or was being used by a botmaster for a particular attack, then whoever had commandeered the
machine probably wouldn&rsquo;t want other attackers to come in behind him and also infect the
machine and interfere with the planned attacks.</p>

<h2 id="worm-outbreaks-in-detail">Worm Outbreaks in Detail</h2>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig15.9.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The summer of 2001 essentially saw a new era in internet security with three major worm
outbreaks. These three major worms were Code Red 1, version two, Code Red 2, and Nimda.
Let&rsquo;s take a quick look at each of these worms. Code Red 1 was released on July 13th, 2001, and
was the first modern worm. It exploited a buffer overflow in Microsoft&rsquo;s IIS server. From the
first through the twentieth of each month it would spread by finding new targets using a random
scan of IP address space, it would spawn 99 new threads, which generated IP addresses at
random, and then looked for vulnerable instances of IIS. Now version 2 of Code Red 1 was
actually released six days later and fixed that random scanning bug so that each instance of the
worm scanned a different part of IP address space. After the scanning bug was fixed, the worm
was able to compromise 350,000 vulnerable hosts in a matter of only fourteen hours. By most
estimates that was the complete set of hosts running the vulnerable version of IIS on the entire
internet. The payload of this worm was to mount a denial of service attack on whitehouse.gov.
But a bug in the coding caused the worm to die on the 20th of each month. If the victim&rsquo;s clock
was wrong, however, the worm would actually resurrect itself on the first. Fortunately in this
case, the payload which launched the denial of service attack on whitehouse.gov actually was
launched at a particular IP address, not at the domain name. So the operators of the website
needed only to move the web server to another IP address to defend against the denial of service
attack. A better worm design would have been much more catastrophic. Code Red 2 exploited
the same vulnerability but had a completely different payload. It was released on August 4th,
2001, and was called Code Red 2 mainly because of a comment in the code. The worm actually
only spread on Windows. The scan actually preferred nearby addresses. It would choose
addresses from the same /8 with probability one half from the same /16 with probability three
eighths, and randomly from the entire internet with the remaining one eighth probability. The
reason for preferring nearby IP addresses is that if there was one vulnerable host on the network,
there was likely to be more because the same administrator that failed to patch the compromised
machine might have other machines on the same network that were also vulnerable. This notion
of preferential scanning can speed up infections in some cases by increasing the probability that
scanning will find another vulnerable host. The payload of this worm was an IIS backdoor, and
the worm was completely dead, by design, by October 1, 2001. Nimba was released on
September 18, 2001, and was interesting mostly because it spread using multiple propagation
vectors. It was effectively multi-model. So in addition to using the same IIS vulnerability as
Code Red 1 and Code Red 2, there were some additional vectors that it used. It could spread by
bulk email as an attachment. It copied itself across open network shares. It installed an exploit
code on webpages on the corresponding web server running on the machine, so that any browser
that visited the webpage for that server would become infected itself and it would scan for the
Code Red 2 backdoors that that worm had installed. The interesting thing about the multi-modal
nature of the Nimda worm is that signature based defenses don&rsquo;t necessarily help because of the
many ways that it could spread, for example, by email or via a website exploit. Nimda actually
needs firewalls. Most of the firewalls pass the email carrying Nimda completely untouched,
using brand new infection with an unknown signature, and those scanners couldn&rsquo;t detect it. This
was the first instance of a worm that exploited what we would call a zero day attack which is
when a worm first appears in the wild and the signature of the worm is not extracted until
minutes, or hours later. Zero day attacks are particularly virulent because the worm can spread
extremely quickly before any type of signature-based antivirus has a chance to catch up and
prevent the infections in the first place.</p>

<h3 id="modeling-fast-spreading-worms">Modeling Fast-Spreading Worms</h3>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig15.10.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here is a plot showing infection rate of the Code 1 Version Two Worm which ultimately infected
350,000 vulnerable hosts. Note the shape of this curve. The worm is effectively dormant or
spreading extremely slowly for quite a period of time. And then there&rsquo;s a inflection point at
which point the infection rate becomes exponential. At some point then, infections slow and the
infection rate ultimately plateaus, presumably after all of the infected hosts have been found. We
can actually model the spread of these worms using the random constant spread model. If &lsquo;K is
the initial compromised rate, &lsquo;N is the number of vulnerable hosts, and &lsquo;a&rsquo; is the fraction of hosts
already compromised, we can now express the number of hosts infected at a particular time
increment in terms of the machines already infected and the rate at which uninfected machines
become compromised. So if &lsquo;Nda&rsquo; is the number of newly infected machines in dt, we can
express that in terms of the number of machines already infected, which is &lsquo;N&rsquo; times &lsquo;a&rsquo;. So these
are the host already capable of doing more scanning, and now &lsquo;K&rsquo; times 1 minus &lsquo;a&rsquo; is the rate at
which uninfected machines become compromised in a particular time interval dt. If we solve for
&lsquo;a&rsquo;, the fraction of hosts compromised, which is effectively the y-axis of this graph, we get the
following. You get an exponential curve that is exponential where the growth rate depends only
on K, or the initial compromise rate. This is very interesting because it tells us that if we want to
design a very fast spreading worm, then we should design a worm such that the initial
compromise rate is as high as possible. So how do we increase K? Or how do we increase that
initial compromise rate?</p>

<h3 id="increasing-compromise-rate">Increasing Compromise Rate</h3>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig15.11.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>One possibility for increasing the initial compromise rate, or designing a very fast spreading
worm, is to create a hit list, or a list of vulnerable hosts ahead of time. That curve we just saw
shows that the time to infect the first 10,000 hosts dominates infection time. So if we start by
performing stealthy scans or some reconnaissance to construct a list of vulnerable hosts before
we start spreading, then we can get rid of that initial flat part of the curve where the worm is
effectively dormant. The second approach is to use something called permutation scanning
where every compromised host has a shared permutation of an IP address list to scan for
vulnerabilities. Now if this list is randomly permuted and a particular host starts scanning from
its own IP address in the list and works down, then different affected hosts will start scanning
from different parts of this list ensuring that compromised hosts don&rsquo;t duplicate each other&rsquo;s
work.</p>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig15.12.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>One worm that exploited these techniques to spread particularly quickly was the Slammer worm,
which spread in January of 2003, exploiting a buffer overflow in Microsoft&rsquo;s SQL server. In
addition to using fast scanning techniques, the entire slammer code fit in a single, small UDP
packet. The UDP packet contained the worm binary, followed by an overflow pointer back to
itself. It was a classic buffer overflow combined with random scanning. Once the control is
passed to the worm code, it randomly generated IP addresses and attempted to send a copy of
itself to Port 1434 on other hosts. One brilliant aspect of the slammer worm is that because it was
spread via a single UDP packet, it was connectionless, meaning that it could spread and was no
longer limited by the latency of network round trip time, but only by the bandwidth of the
network. The worm caused $1.2 billion dollars in damage and temporarily knocked out many
elements of critical infrastructure including Bank of America&rsquo;s ATM network, an entire cell
phone network in South Korea, and five route DNS servers, as well as Continental Airlines&rsquo;
ticket processing software. The worm actually did not have a malicious payload, but the
bandwidth exhaustion on the network caused resource exhaustion on the infected machines.
Here&rsquo;s a picture of the hosts around the world that Slammer infected. This damage was inflicted
in just thirty minutes, due to the very lightweight nature in which Slammer spread.</p>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig15.13.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>So as a quick quiz, what allowed the Slammer worm to spread so quickly? Was it that TCPs
reliable transport ensured a clean copy of the worm payload would spread to different vulnerable
hosts? Was it that the worm spread by UDP, thereby enabling itself to spread with limited
network overhead? Was it that it could infect many different types of operating systems
including Linux and Mac OS? Or, was it that it could fit in a single packet?</p>

<h3 id="slammer-worm-quiz-answer">Slammer Worm Quiz Answer</h3>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig15.14.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Slammer was able to spread quickly because it spread via connectionless transport, or UDP, and
because it could fit in a single packet.</p>
