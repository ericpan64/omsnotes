<h2 id="traffic-engineering">Traffic Engineering</h2>

<p>We just completed our exploration of software defined networking, and now we&rsquo;re
jumping into traffic engineering. Traffic engineering is a fancy way of describing how network
operators deal with large amounts of data flowing through their networks. Companies like
Google are doing exciting work in this area, so be sure to pay attention to the instructor note
section, where we&rsquo;ll highlight exciting research papers.</p>

<h2 id="traffic-engineering-overview">Traffic Engineering Overview</h2>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.0.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This lesson covers traffic engineering. Traffic engineering is the process of reconfiguring the
network in response to changing traffic loads to achieve some operational goal. A network
operator might want to reconfigure the network in response to changing loads to, for example,
maintain traffic ratios in a peering relationship, or to relieve congestion on certain links in the
network, or to balance load more evenly across the available links in the network. In this lesson
we will explore different ways of performing traffic engineering. We will start by looking at
conventional approaches to traffic engineering and we&rsquo;ll explore how software-defined
networking is used to make the process of traffic engineering easier in both data center networks
and transit networks.</p>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>IP networks must be managed. Now, in some sense, IP networks manage themselves. There are
several examples of protocols on the internet that in some sense manage themselves. TCP
senders send less traffic during congestion and routing protocols will adapt to topology changes.
The problem is that even though these protocols are designed to adapt to various changes, the
network may not run efficiently. There may be congested links when idle paths exist or there
might be a high-delay path that some traffic is taking when a low-delay path, in fact, exists. So a
key question that traffic engineering tries to address is how routing should adapt to traffic. In
particular, traffic engineering attempts to avoid congested links and satisfy certain application
requirements such as delay. These are, in some sense, the essential questions that traffic
engineering attempts to answer.</p>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In the rest of this lesson we will look at how network operators can tune a routing protocol
configuration to affect how network traffic traverses the links in the network. And in particular
we will look at both intradomain traffic engineering, that is how to reconfigure the protocols
within a single autonomous system to adjust traffic flows, as well as interdomain traffic
engineering, or how to adjust how traffic flows between autonomous systems. We will also look
at multi-path routing and how it is used to achieve various traffic engineering goals. Let&rsquo;s start by
looking at how network operators can tune static link weights in a routing protocol like OSPF or
ISIS, to affect how traffic flows through the network.</p>

<h2 id="intradomain-traffic-engineering">Intradomain Traffic Engineering</h2>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s assume that we have a single autonomous system with static link weights as shown. In such
a setup, routers will flood information to one another to learn the network topology, including
the link weights on links connecting individual routers. An operator can affect how traffic flows
through the network by configuring the link weights. By changing the link weight configuration,
an operator can affect the shortest path between two points in this graph, thus affecting the way
that traffic flows. In the link weight settings shown here, traffic would flow along the green path.</p>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.4.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Suppose that the operator would like to shift traffic off of a congested link in the middle of the
network such as this one by changing the link weight from one to three. The shortest path
between this node and this node, now takes an alternate route. So we can see from this simple
example, that by adjusting the link weights in an intra-domain topology, the operator can affect
how traffic flows between different points in the network, thus affecting the load on the network
links. In practice, network operators set these link weights in a variety of ways. One could set the
link weights inversely proportional to capacity, proportional to propagation delay, or the operator
might perform some network wide optimization based on traffic.</p>

<h3 id="measuring-modeling-and-controlling-traffic">Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Traffic</h3>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.5.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Traffic engineering has three steps: measuring the network to figure out the current traffic loads,
forming a model of how configuration affects the underlying paths in the network, and then
ultimately reconfiguring the network to exert control over how the traffic flows through the
network. An operator might measure the topology and traffic, feed the topology and traffic to a
what-if model that predicts what will happen under various types of configuration changes,
decide which changes to affect on the network, and then, ultimately, control the network
behavior by readjusting link weights. So, in summary, we have measurement, modeling and
control. Each of these three components requires a significant amount of heavy lifting to make
both practical and accurate in practice.</p>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.6.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Intradomain traffic engineering attempts to solve an optimization problem where the input is the
graph G, where R is the set of routers, and L is the set of unidirectional links. Each link L also
has a fixed capacity. Another input is the traffic matrix ,or offered traffic load, where M_ij
represents the traffic load from router i to router j. The output of the optimization problem is a
set of link weights, where w_l is the weight on any unidirectional link l in the network topology.
Ultimately, the setting of these link weights should result in a fraction of the traffic from i to j,
traversing each link l, such that those fractions satisfy the network-wide objective function.
Defining an objective function is tricky. We could talk about, for example, minimizing the
maximum congested link in the network, evenly splitting traffic loads across links, and so forth.</p>

<h3 id="link-utilization-function">Link Utilization Function</h3>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.7.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>What we&rsquo;d like to represent is that the cost of congestion increases in a quadratic manner as the
loads on the links continue to increase, ultimately becoming increasingly expensive as link
utilization approaches one. Solving the optimization problem, however, is much easier if we use
a piecewise linear cost function. We can define utilization as the amount of traffic on the link
divided by the capacity and our objective might be to minimize the sum of this piecewise linear
cost function over all the links in the network. Unfortunately, solving this optimization is still
NP-complete, which means that there is no efficient algorithm to find the optimal setting of link
weights, even for simple objective functions.</p>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The implications of this are that we have to resort to searching through a large set of
combinations of link weight settings to ultimately find a good setting. So clearly searching
through all the link weights is suboptimal, but the graphs turn out to be small enough in practice
such that this approach is still reasonably effective. In practice, we also have other operational
realities to worry about. For example, minimizing the number of changes to the network. Often
just changing one or two link weights is enough to achieve a good traffic load balance solution.
Whatever solution we come up with must be resistant to failure and it should be robust to
measurement noise. We also want to limit the frequency of changes that we make to the network.
This completes our overview of intradomain routing.</p>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.9.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And now we will take a look at interdomain routing. Intradomain routing and traffic engineering
concerns traffic flow within a single domain, such as an ISP, a campus network, or a data center.
In contrast, interdomain routing and interdomain traffic engineering concerns routing that occurs
between domains, something that we looked at before in the context of the Border Gateway
Protocol.</p>

<h3 id="interdomain-routing-quiz">Interdomain Routing Quiz</h3>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.10.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Before we proceed with our discussion of interdomain traffic engineering, let&rsquo;s take a brief quiz
reminding ourselves about the differences between intradomain routing and interdomain routing.</p>

<p>Which of the following are examples of interdomain routing? Peering between two internet
service providers? Peering between a university network, and its ISP? Peering at an internet
exchange point? Routing inside a data center? Or routing across multiple data centers? Please,
again, check all that apply.</p>

<h3 id="interdomain-routing-quiz-answer">Interdomain Routing Quiz Answer</h3>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.11.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Peering between two ISPs involves interdomain routing, as does peering between a university
network and its ISP, or any peering at an Internet exchange point, for that matter. Routing
between multiple data centers typically involves routing in a wide area, and hence may involve
interdomain routing. Routing within a single data center concerns routing in a single domain and
hence does not concern interdomain routing.</p>

<h3 id="bgp-in-interdomain-traffic-engineering">BGP in Interdomain Traffic Engineering</h3>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.12.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Inter-domain routing concerns routing between domains or autonomous systems. It involves the
reconfiguration of the border gateway protocol, policies or configurations that are running on
individual routers in the network. Changing BGP policies at these edge routers can cause routers
inside an autonomous system to direct traffic to or away from certain edge links. We can also
change the set of egress links for a particular destination. For example, an operator of
autonomous system one might observe traffic to destination D traversing the green path.</p>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.13.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>But by adjusting BGP policies, the operator might balance load across these two edge links, or
shift all of the traffic for that destination to the lower path.</p>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.14.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>An operator might wish to use inter domain traffic engineering if an edge link is congested, if a
link is upgraded, or if there&rsquo;s some violation of a peering agreement. For example, AS1 and AS
have an agreement that they only send a certain amount of traffic load over that link in a
particular time window. If the load exceeds that amount, an operator would need to use BGP to
shift traffic from one egress link to another.</p>

<h3 id="interdomain-traffic-engineering-goals">Interdomain Traffic Engineering Goals</h3>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.15.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Effective Inter-domain Traffic Engineering has three goals. One is predictability. In other words,
it should be possible to predict how traffic flows will change in response to changes in the
network configuration. Another goal is to, limit the influence of neighboring domains. In
particular, we&rsquo;d like to use BGP policies and changes to those policies that limit how neighboring
ASes might change their behavior in response to changes to the PGP configuration that we make
in our own network. And finally, we&rsquo;d like to reduce the overhead of routing changes by
achieving our traffic engineering goals with changes to as few IP prefixes as possible. To
understand the factors that confound predictability Let&rsquo;s look at how the inter-domain routing
choices of a particular autonomous system can wreak havoc on predictability.</p>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.16.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s suppose that a downstream neighbor is trying to reach the autonomous system at the top of
this figure. The AS here might wish to relieve congestion on a particular peering link. To do so,
this AS might now send traffic to that destination out a different set of autonomous systems. But
once this AS makes that change, note that it&rsquo;s choosing a longer AS path. Now taking a path of
three hops rather than two. In response, the downstream neighbor might decide not to send its
traffic for that destination through this autonomous system at all, thus affecting the traffic matrix
that this AS sees. So, all the work that went into optimizing the traffic load balance for this AS is
for naught, because the change that it made effectively changed the offered traffic loads and
hence the traffic matrix. One way to avoid this type of problem and achieve predictable traffic
flow changes is to avoid making changes like this that are globally visible. In particular, note that
this change caused a change in the AS path link of the advertisement to this particular destination
from two to three. Thus, other neighbors, such as the downstream neighbor here, might decide to
use an alternate path as a result of that globally visible routing change. By avoiding these types
of globally visible changes, we can achieve predictability. Another way to achieve effective
interdomain traffic engineering is to limit the influence of neighbors. For example, an
autonomous system might try to make a path look longer with AS path prepending. If we
consider treating paths that have almost the same AS path length as a common group, we can
achieve additional flexibility. Additionally, if we enforce a constraint that our neighbors should
advertise consistent BGP route advertisements over multiple peering links (should multiple
appearing links exist), ghat gives us additional flexibility to send traffic over different egress
points to the same autonomous system, enforcing egress points to the same autonomous system.
Enforcing consistent advertisements turns out to be difficult in practice, but it is doable. To
reduce the overhead of routing changes, we can group related prefixes. Rather than exploring all
combinations of prefixes to move a particular volume of traffic, we can identify routing choices
that group routes that have the same AS paths, and we can move groups of prefixes according to
these groups of prefixes that share an AS path. This allows us to move groups of prefixes by
making tweaks to local preference on regular expressions on AS path. We can also focus on the
small fraction of prefixes that carry the majority of traffic. Ten percent of origin AS is
responsible for about 82 percent of outbound traffic. Therefore we can achieve significant gains
in rebalancing traffic in the network by focusing on the heavy hitters.</p>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.17.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In summary, to achieve predictability, we effect changes that are not globally visible. To limit
the influence of neighbors, we enforce consistent advertisements and limit the influence of AS
pass length. And to reduce the overhead of routing changes, we group pre fixed according to
those that have common AS paths and move traffic in terms of groups of prefixes.</p>

<h2 id="multipath-routing">Multipath Routing</h2>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.18.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Another way to perform traffic engineering is with Multipath Routing, where an operator can
establish multiple paths in advance. This approach applies both to intradomain routing and
interdomain routing. The way this is done in intradomain routing is to set link weights such that
multiple paths of equal cost exist between two nodes in the graph. This approach is called equal
cost multipath.</p>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.19.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Thus traffic will be split across paths that have equal costs through the network. A source router
might also be able to change the fraction of traffic that&rsquo;s sent along each one of these paths.
Sending, for example, 35% along the top path and 65% along the bottom path.</p>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.20.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It might even be able to do this based on the level of congestion that&rsquo;s observed along these
paths. The way that the router would do this is by having multiple forwarding table entries with
different next hops for outgoing packets to the same destination.</p>

<h3 id="source-router-path-quiz">Source Router Path Quiz</h3>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.21.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>So quickly, how can a source router adjust paths to a destination when there are multiple paths to
the destination? Dropping packets to cause TCB backoff, alternating between multiple
forwarding table entries to the same destination, or sending alerts to incoming senders whenever
a route changes?</p>

<h3 id="source-router-path-quiz-answer">Source Router Path Quiz Answer</h3>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.22.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>A source router can adjust traffic over multiple paths by having multiple forwarding table entries
for the same destination and splitting traffic flows across the multiple next hops depending on,
for example, the hash of the IP packet header.</p>

<h2 id="data-center-networking">Data Center Networking</h2>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.23.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s now talk about data center networking and how network operators perform traffic
engineering inside a data center. First of all, what characterizes a data center? Data center
network has 3 important characteristics. One is multi-tenancy. Multi-tenancy allows a data center
provider to advertise the cost of shared infrastructure, but because there are multiple independent
users, the infrastructure must also provide some level of security and resource isolation. Data
Center network resources are also elastic, meaning that as demand for service fluctuates, the
operator can expand and contract these resources. It also can be pay per use, meaning that as the
need to use more resources arises or disappears, a service provider can adjust how much
resources are devoted to the particular service running in the data center. Another characteristic
of data center networking is flexible service management, or the ability to move work, or
workloads, to other locations inside the data center. For example, as load changes for a particular
service, an operator may need to provision additional virtual machines, or servers to handle the
load for that service or potentially move it to a completely different set of servers inside the
infrastructure. This workload movement and virtual machine migration essentially creates the
need for traffic engineering solutions inside a data center. A key enabling technology in data
center networking is the ability to virtualize servers. This makes it possible to quickly provision,
move, and migrate servers and services in response to fluctuations in workload. But while
provisioning servers and moving them is relatively easy, we must also develop traffic
engineering solutions that allow the network to reconfigure in response to changing workloads
and migrating services.</p>

<h3 id="data-center-networking-challenges">Data Center Networking Challenges</h3>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.24.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Some of the challenges for data center networking include traffic load balance, support for
migrating virtual machines in response to changing demands, adjusting server and traffic
placement to save power, provisioning the network when demands fluctuate, and providing
various security guarantees, particularly in scenarios that involve multiple tenants. To understand
these challenges in a bit more detail, let&rsquo;s take a look at a typical data center topology.</p>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.25.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>A topology typically has three layers: an access layer, which connects the servers themselves. An
aggregation layer which connects the access layer, and then the core. Historically, the core of the
network has been connected with layer three, but increasingly, modern data centers are
connected with an entire layer-two topology. A layer-two topology makes it easier to perform
migration of services from one part of the topology to another, since these services can stay on
the same layer-two network and hence would not need new IP addresses when they moved. It
also becomes easier to load balance traffic. On the other hand, a monolithic layer-two topology
makes scaling difficult, since now we have tens of thousands of servers on a single flat topology.
In other words, layer-two addresses are not topological. So the forwarding tables in these
switches can&rsquo;t scale as easily, because they can&rsquo;t take advantage of the natural hierarchy that
exists in the topology. Other problems that exist in this type of topology is that the hierarchy can
potentially create single points of failure, and links at the top of the topology, in the core, can
become oversubscribed. Modern data center operators have observed that as you move from the
bottom of the hierarchy up towards the core, that the links at the top can carry as much as 200
times as much traffic as the links at the bottom of the hierarchy. So there&rsquo;s a serious capacity
mismatch in that the top part of the topology has to carry a whole lot more traffic than the
bottom. We&rsquo;ll explore how modern data center network architectures address these various
challenges, but let&rsquo;s first take a quick look at one way of solving the scale problem.</p>

<h3 id="data-center-topologies">Data Center Topologies</h3>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.26.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Recall that the Scale problem arises because we have tens of thousands of servers on a flat layer
two topology, where all of the servers have a topology independent MAC or hardware address
and thus, in the default case every switch in the topology has to store a forwarding table entry for
every single MAC address. One solution is to introduce what are called pods and assign pseudo
MAC addresses to each server corresponding to the pod in which they&rsquo;re location is in the
Topology. So in addition to having a real MAC address, each server has what&rsquo;s known as a
pseudo-MAC address, as shown in pink. Thus, switches in the Data Centre Topology no longer
need to maintain forwarding table entries for every host. They only need to maintain entries for
reaching other pods in the Topology. Once a frame answers a pod, the switch then of course has
entries for all of the servers inside that pod but they don&rsquo;t need to maintain entries for the MAC
addresses for servers outside of each pod. For example, the switch in pod one only needs to
maintain entries for these two servers with MAC addresses A and B, but it doesn&rsquo;t need to
maintain independent entries with servers with MAC addresses C and D. It only needs to
maintain an entry for how to reach pod 2. Likewise for pods 2 and pods 3. Now, in such a Data
Centre Topology, of course, these hosts are unmodified so they&rsquo;re still going to respond to things
like ARP queries with their real MAC addresses. So we need a way of dealing with that, as well
as a way of Mapping pseudo MAC addresses to real MAC addresses.</p>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.27.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The solution is as follows. When a host such as server A issues an ARP query, that query is
intercepted by the switch,. But instead of flooding that query, the switch intercepts the query and
forwards it to an entity called the Fabric Manager. The Fabric Manager then responds with the
pseudo-MAC corresponding to that IP address. Host A then sends the frame with the destination
pseudo-MAC address, and switches in the Topology can forward that frame to the appropriate
pod sorresponding to the pseudo MAC address of the destination server. Once the frame reaches
the destination pod, let&rsquo;s say in this case pod 3, the switch at the top of that pod can then map the
pseudo MAC address back to the real MAC address. And the server that receives the frame
receives an Ethernet frame with its real destination MAC address, so it knows that the Ethernet
frame was intended for it. By intercepting our queries in this way and providing a Mapping
between topological pseudo MAC addresses and real, physical MAC addresses, we can achieve
hierarchical forwarding in a large Layer 2 Topology without having to modify any host software.</p>

<h3 id="data-center-intradomain-traffic-engineering">Data Center (Intradomain) Traffic Engineering</h3>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.28.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In this lesson, we will look at how data center traffic engineering, through customized topologies
and special mechanisms for load balance, can help reduce link utilization, reduce the number of
hops to reach the edge of the data center, and make the data center network easier to maintain.
We saw in the last lesson how existing data center topologies provide extremely limited server to
server capacity because of the over subscription of the links at the top of the hierarchy.
Additionally, as services continue to be migrated to different parts of the data center, resources
can be fragmented, significantly lowering utilization. For example, if the service denoted by
green is running mostly in one part of the data center, but there&rsquo;s a little bit running on a virtual
machine in another part of the data center, this might cause traffic to traverse links of the data
center topology hierarchy, thus significantly lowering utilization and cost efficiency. Reducing
this type of fragmentation can result in complicated layer two or layer three routing
reconfiguration. What we&rsquo;d like to have is just the abstraction of one large layer to switch. This
is the abstraction that VL2 provides. So, VL2 has two main objectives. One is to achieve layer-
two semantics across the entire data center topology. This is done with a name-location
separation and a resolution service that resembles the fabric manager which we talked about in
the last lesson and which is described in more detail in the paper. To achieve uniform high
capacity between the servers and balance load across links in topology, VL2 relies on flow-based
random traffic interaction using valiant load balancing. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at how that load
balancing works.</p>

<h3 id="valiant-load-balancing">Valiant Load Balancing</h3>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.29.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The goals of Valiant load balancing in the VL2 network are to spread traffic evenly across the
servers, and to ensure that traffic load is balanced independently of the destinations of the traffic
flows. Field two achieves this by inserting an indirection level into the switching hierarchy.
When a switch at the access layer wants to send traffic to a destination, it first selects a switch at
the indirection level to send the traffic at random. This intermediate switch then forwards the
traffic to the ultimate destination depending on the destination MAC address of the traffic.
Subsequent flows might pick different indirection points for the traffic, at random. This notion of
picking a random indirection point to balance traffic more evenly across a topology, actually
comes from multi-processor architectures and has been rediscovered in the context of data
centers. So, in this lesson we have explored how valiant load balancing can be used on a slightly
modified topology to achieve better load balance than in traditional fat tree networks, without an
indirection layer and valiant load balancing. In the next lesson we&rsquo;ll look at how a custom
random topology can make some of these traffic engineering problems even easier.</p>

<h2 id="jellyfish-data-center-topology">Jellyfish Data Center Topology</h2>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.30.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In this lesson we&rsquo;ll look at Jellyfish, a technique to network data centers randomly. The goals of
Jellyfish are to achieve high throughput to support, for example, big data analytics or agile
placement of virtual machines and incremental expandability, so that network operators can
easily add or replace servers and switches. For example, large companies like Facebook are
adding capacity on a daily basis. Commercial products make it easy to expand or provision
servers in response to changing traffic load but not the network. Unfortunately, the structure of
the data center networks constrains expansion. Structures such as a hypercube require two to the
K switches, where K is the number of servers. Even more efficient topologies, like a FAT tree,
are still quadratic in the number of servers.</p>

<h3 id="data-center-topology-quiz">Data Center Topology Quiz</h3>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.31.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>By looking at this figure showing a data center topology where the servers are at the edge of the
graph, can you try to figure out where data center topology primarily constrains expansion? Is it
at individual servers, aggregation switches or top-level switches?</p>

<h3 id="data-center-topology-quiz-answer">Data Center Topology Quiz Answer</h3>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.32.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As we can see from the figure, most of the congestion occurs at the top level. Jellyfish&rsquo;s answer
to how data structure constrains expansion is to simply have no structure at all.</p>

<h3 id="jellyfish-random-regular-graph">Jellyfish Random Regular Graph</h3>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.33.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Jellyfish&rsquo;s topology is what is called a random regular graph. It&rsquo;s random because each graph is
uniformly selected at random from the set of all regular graphs. A regular graph is simply one
where each node has the same degree. And a graph in Jellyfish is one where the switches in the
topology are the nodes. In contrast to the earlier data center topology diagram we saw, here is a
picture of a Jellyfish random graph with 432 servers and 180 switches. Every node in this graph
has a fixed degree of 12.</p>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.34.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Jellyfish&rsquo;s approach is to construct a random graph at the Top-of-Rack switch layer. Every Top-
of-Rack switch i, has some total number of K_i ports, of which it uses R_i to connect to other
Top-of-Rack switches. The remaining K_i minus R_i ports are used to connect servers. With N
racks, the network then supports N times K_i minus R_i servers. And the network is a random
regular graph denoted as follows. Formally, random regular graphs are sampled uniformly from
the space of all R regular graphs. Achieving such a property is a complex graph theory problem,
but there&rsquo;s a simple procedure that produces a sufficiently uniform random graph that empirically
have the desired properties.</p>

<h3 id="constructing-a-jellyfish-topology">Constructing a Jellyfish Topology</h3>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.35.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To construct a jellyfish topology, one can simply take the following steps. First, pick a random
switch pair with free ports for which the switch pair are not already neighbors. Next, join them
with a link, and repeat this process until no further links can be added. If a switch remains with
greater than or equal to two free ports, which might happen during the incremental expansion by
adding a new switch, these switches can be incorporated in the topology by removing a uniform
random existing link and adding links to that switch.</p>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.36.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>For a particular equipment cost, using identical equipment, the jelly fish topology can achieve
increased capacity by supporting twenty five percent more servers. This higher capacity is
achieved because the paths through the topology are shorter than they would be in a Fat tree
topology.</p>

<p><img src="/6250/images/fig13.37.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Consider a topology with sixteen servers, twenty switches, and a fixed degree of four for both the
fat tree topology and the jellyfish random graph. In the fat tree topology, only four of 16 servers
are reachable in less than five hops. In contrast, in the jellyfish random graph, there are 12
servers reachable. By making more servers reachable along shorter paths, jellyfish can increase
capacity over a conventional Fat tree topology.</p>

<p>So while Jellyfish shows some promise, there are certainly some open questions. First, how close
are these random graphs to optimal in terms of the optimal throughput that could be achieved for
a particular set of equipment? Second, what about typologies where switches are heterogeneous
with different numbers of ports or link speeds? From a system design perspective, the random
topology model could create problems with physically cabling the datacenter network, and there
are also questions about how to perform routing or congestion control without the structure of a
conventional datacenter network like a fat tree.</p>
